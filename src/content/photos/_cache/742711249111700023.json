There is a slight wind that makes stripes over the water, with the grass and shrubs reflecting in it. It is possible to see a bit of a reflection of the trees from the other side in the water as well."

Further, the towpath splits and a metal fence starts to protect the waterside. The wooden planks of the towpath are slightly shiny from the small past rain, and there are some yellow leaves lying around on it."

Large trees with occasional thin dead branches stand on top of the water, with some of their branches submerged. On the right of the photo it can be slightly seen how the river goes around that green island."

In the middle of the frame a few trees are surrounded by the water, there is some grass and various flowers on top of the water as well: yellow and light purple. There are slight waves from the wind, and a blurry out of focus tree hugging the frame from the left side."
