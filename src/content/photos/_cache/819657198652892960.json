            "alt": "A photo of a few people walking on a terrace of a park, with a background full of skyscrapers of La Défense in the distance. The photo is made with a telephoto lens, resulting in the skyscrapers being seemingly closer to the viewer than they are in comparison to the people. Closer to the camera, there are two persons, one is rolling a wheelchair, another is pointing at something. Further, near the transparent metallic fence, there are four more people. The sky is gray, with the skyscrapers nearly merging with it."
