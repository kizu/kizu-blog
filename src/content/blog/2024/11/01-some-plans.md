Guess what? It is November. Last year, I went all out and published one post a day for the full month.

On one hand, that was hard, and took its toll on me. On the other, I _did_ publish a bunch of stuff that would usually stay in the drafts.

I don’t know if I will manage to do the same this month — but I want to try again.

## What

One thing I would like to try to do: make this a bit more of a _blog_. A few months ago, I started writing down weekly notes at my work, and found it to be a good way to track what I did achieve.

And, as I look back, many of last November’s posts were also just that: documenting my bug reports, WPT tests, CSSWG issues.

I need to find a good workflow to document and post stuff like that, and maybe a bit more of personal things, like posting [photos from the walks](https://pixey.org/i/web/profile/546076540786363642), sharing my [favorite music](https://www.last.fm/user/ki_zu), my setup, or just anything else.

## Next Week

Next week I will attend two things:

1. [beyond tellerrand](https://beyondtellerrand.com/events/berlin-2024) conference in Berlin.

2. [IndieWebCamp](https://indieweb.org/2024/Berlin) after it.

I already have many plans about what I want to do with my website and this blog, and having both of these events to think more about it feels convenient.

While I could only visit the first day of IndieWebCamp, I’ll try to hack on my website during my travel back for the second day.

## Bookmarks

As it is often the case for me with periodic things: I tend to always drop them. Well, as I have written in [the latest bookmarks post](https://blog.kizu.dev/recent-css-bookmarks-017/), the backlog of the bookmarks I gathered is unmanageable!

I’ll try to come up with a better workflow for it, one that would actually _work_ for me.

With me giving up on posting the bookmarks weekly, and the need to write up one post a day in November, I could always share one or two bookmarks as the fallback.

## Experiments

Is the backlog of my experiments and article drafts is as big as for my bookmarks? Well, maybe not that big, but I have _many things_ brewing in my lab.

I even managed to finally publish [“Possible Future CSS: Tree-Counting Functions and Random Values”](https://kizu.dev/tree-counting-and-random/) — an article about some of my experiments that I started _last year_.

There is more in the works. Nothing is fast when each time I touch some code, a browser bug crawls out of it and crashes the party. Or the browser. Had two of these last month alone!

## More Plans

Or, actually, fewer? After starting writing this post, I have so many things I want to share. But: I will have the whole month for it. Nice.
