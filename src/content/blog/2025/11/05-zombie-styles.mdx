This is a short post about one thing I encounter a lot, but never saw explicitly defined for easy reference. This is my attempt:

<dl style="display: block; font-size: 1em;">
	<dt>Zombie Styles <em>(noun)</em></dt>
	<dd>Dormant styles that break the UI after a configuration change.</dd>
</dl>

## What do _Zombie Styles_ mean?

_Zombie Styles_ refer to CSS styles that exist in the document’s stylesheet, but are _dead_, usually due to being overridden by other declarations. In their dormant form, they do not impact anything in the UI, and do not activate under normal circumstances.

However, some confuguration change can bring them to life unintentionally, and now that they’re applying, they affect the UI and wreak havoc.

## Examples of _Zombie Styles_

### Forgotten Styles

The most common case of this happens when the same styles exist in multiple files, or in the same file but separated by other rules or declarations.

```CSS
.Foo {
	background: pink;
	/* 100 very useful design-tokens */
	background: lightgreen;
}
```

Or

```CSS
.Foo {
	background: pink;
}

/* Many rules after, or maybe even in another file */

.Foo {
	background: lightgreen;
}
```

When you look at a long stylesheet and only see a portion of styles, you might think “Maybe, I want the background of this `Foo` component to be transparent” and you then remove the `background: lightgreen` declaration. But somewhere there was a declaration hidden: it never applied before, but now it jumps and makes you spend another few minutes debugging your code.

The first case is easy to catch if you use [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/) via a [`declaration-block-no-duplicate-properties` rule](https://stylelint.io/user-guide/rules/declaration-block-no-duplicate-properties/), but more complex cases can be harder to spot.

Generally, it is a good idea to never repeat selectors, separating styles that are applied together in the code.

### Import Order Change

In SPAs (Shitty-Produced Applications) that load chunks of CSS based on the import order, different “pages” can include components in different order.

Let’s say we have this HTML:

```HTML
<section class="ComponentA">
	<p class="ComponentB">I am alive</p>
</section>
```

And these two that components have the following styles:

```CSS
.ComponentA > * {
	background: pink;
}
```

```CSS
.ComponentB {
	background: lightgreen;
}
```

Both of these styles have the same specificity, and a page can be built with the expectation that the `ComponentA` will always be imported before the `ComponentB`. The `background: pink` never applies.

Then, suddenly, somewhere in the app, `ComponentB` is included _before_ the `ComponentA`, and now the styles' order changes.

The declaration that was previously “dormant” activates. Oops. It might be the time to rethink your whole CSS architecture.

## Were You Also Bitten?

Confess. Do you have bite marks from zombie styles? It is safe to confide in this: unlike normal zombies, zombie styles, usually, don’t convert you into CSS declarations.

Usually.

Please let me know which examples of zombie styles you have encountered. How did you fight them? Or did you just run away?
