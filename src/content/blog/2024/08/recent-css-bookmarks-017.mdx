Oops, more than three months without sharing bookmarks. My excuse: I spoke at CSS Day, and went to a CSS Working Group face-to-face in A Coruña, and then rested for a bit. And then the backlog of articles to read grew and grew, becoming unmanageable.

Instead of trying to go through the whole backlog in one go, I grouped all the bookmarks, and will post them group-by-group.

Today, it is all about layouts.

- [“Learn Grid Now, Container Queries Can Wait”](https://www.oddbird.net/2024/06/13/css-layout/) by [Miriam Suzanne](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/) — a call to start using CSS grids more, as they’re already available for quite a long time, and are very cool. Use them.

- [“The Gap”](https://ishadeed.com/article/the-gap/) by [Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/) — an article about the history of how we used `margin` property in the past, and how the `gap` property in flex and grid layouts eliminates many pain points of margins.

- [“CSS Grid Areas”](https://ishadeed.com/article/css-grid-area/) by [Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/) — a deep exploration of how grid areas work, with many interactive examples and use cases.

- [“Modern CSS Layouts: You Might Not Need A Framework For That”](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2024/05/modern-css-layouts-no-framework-needed/) by [Brecht De Ruyte](https://utilitybend.com/) — an article about four reusable and configurable layouts based on CSS flex and grid modules.

- [“Responsive bar charts in HTML and CSS”](https://9elements.com/blog/responsive-bar-charts-in-html-and-css/) by [Mathias Schäfer](https://molily.de/) — a case-study of migrating a chart built with SVG to HTML&CSS as a way to make it responsive, with the help of a CSS grid layout, including using subgrids and logical properties.

- [“Absolute positioning with CSS grid”](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/absolute-positioning-with-css-grid) by [Elaina Natario](https://www.elainanatario.com/) — a post about one useful aspect of CSS grids: an ability to place elements into overlapping areas, either fully reusing the same grid area, or create intersecting ones.

- [“In defense of asymmetric grids”](https://csscade.com/in-defense-of-asymmetric-grids/) by [Robin Rendle](https://robinrendle.com/) — a short post about how CSS grids allow us to have any grids we want and not just a common 12-columns one (which is still effortless to do with them).

- [“Fluid Breakout Layout with CSS Grid”](https://www.viget.com/articles/fluid-breakout-layout-css-grid/) by [Nathan Long](https://nathan-long.com/) — an article about how we can set up a complex grid with many defined grid lines that allow us to create complex breakout layouts. It defines the lines using `grid-template-columns`, which, in my opinion, is a bit cumbersome, so I invite you to also look at my old [“Grid Projection Naming”](https://kizu.dev/grid-projection-naming/) article about how we can use `grid-template-areas` to simplify this.

- [“Yet another take on layout breakouts”](https://noahliebman.net/2024/05/yet-another-take-on-layout-breakouts/) by [Noah Liebman](https://noahliebman.net/) — a post about another way to do simple breakout layouts by using negative margins and `max-inline-size`.

- [“Request for developer feedback on `reading-flow` and elements with `display: contents`”](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/reading-flow-display-contents) by [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/) — a post about the property previously drafted as `reading-order-items`, its current status and a call for feedback over how it should work with `display: contents`.

- [“Let’s make a floating button sign up form pattern”](https://piccalil.li/blog/lets-make-a-floating-button-sign-up-form-pattern/) by [Andy Bell](https://andy-bell.co.uk/) — a case study of creating a micro-layout for an input+button pattern, going into numerous nuances related to accessibility and responsiveness related to it.

- [“Fit-to-Width Text: A New Technique”](https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width/) by me — while it is not really about layouts, this technique uses flexbox inside, as a workaround for not being able to apply container query to an element with an intrinsic width.
