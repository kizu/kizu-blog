Writing one post a day is hard! I had an idea for an [observation](https://blog.kizu.dev/tags/observation/) but did not have an opportunity to write it up properly. Come on, me, these should not take that long!

That means I am falling back to the idea I reserved for cases like this one: where I cannot quickly come up with a post on the spot. That is: share just a few recent bookmarks!

Here they are! This time, they’re ordered from longer to shorter.

- [“Overflow Clip”](https://ishadeed.com/article/overflow-clip/) by [Ahmad Shadeed](https://ishadeed.com/) — an article explaining the `clip` value of the `overflow` property and where it can be used. Fun fact: the ideas for some of my experiments with scroll-driven animations, that later became [“Fit-to-Width Text”](https://kizu.dev/fit-to-width-text/) and [“Position-Driven Styles”](https://kizu.dev/position-driven-styles/) articles, came from me reading the [specs for `overflow: clip`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-overflow/#valdef-overflow-clip), specifically its difference from `hidden`. The `clip` value is cool, and [well-supported](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_overflow_clip) — play with it!

- [“The `stretch` keyword: a better alternative to `width: 100%` in CSS?”](https://fullystacked.net/stretch/) by [Ollie Williams](https://fullystacked.net/) — a post about the [new standard sizing value](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-sizing-4/#valdef-width-stretch), which is now implemented in Chrome, and will come as a replacement for `-moz-available` and `-webkit-fill-available` (and could be potentially used in more contexts).

- [“How to correctly use `steps()` with animations”](https://css-tip.com/steps/) by [Temani Afif](https://css-articles.com/) — a quick tip about the `steps()` easing function for CSS animations, specifically its `jump-none` value for `<step-position>`. This is something I did not play much, so it was new to me! And I can already remember how some places where I struggled before could’ve been solved by this tiny trick. I recommend reading [the specs for `steps()`](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-easing/#funcdef-steps) — there are some nice _animations_ that demonstrate how its different values work!

I wonder: have you noticed a common theme between these three bookmarks? Please tell me if you did spot it!
