A window on the ground floor is surrounded by vegetation: some vines, and many pots with different plants standing on the ground. The street is covered by cobblestone and with a metallic sewer grate visible. There are stone cones guarding the pots, the buildings are painted with beige. There is a sign on the corner of a building: “Rue du Gast”, and another sign with smaller text visible under the vegetation: “Dépôt de déchets et encombrants au sol interdit sous peine de poursuites”."
