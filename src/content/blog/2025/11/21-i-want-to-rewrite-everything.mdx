This whole week, I am switching between writing posts in this blog and working on my next article for my [main site](https://kizu.dev/).

My blog has a much more modern setup for writing posts: it is based on [Astro](https://astro.build/), and I enjoy tweaking the components that I use with it, like with my yesterday’s [“Scope for Examples”](/scope-for-examples/) post.

Writing posts with this setup is a joy, where it is effortless to add new interactive examples, and adjust things.

The old setup? It is an abomination of some old [gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) custom config, with a bunch of custom JS and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) on top of it. The templating system that it has? One of the worst I used. Honestly, screw React, but JSX and the idea of components are a much better fit for what I usually want for building complex HTML pages. And with Astro not outputting any actual JS and pre-building everything in HTML is just great.

So, all of this might be one of the reasons why I am not writing longer and more polished articles on my site as often. I really would like to rewrite everything that I have there to use the same architecture I am using for my blog.

There are still many features that my old setup has that I did not yet implement here: sidenotes are much better there, examples with screenshots/video alternatives, some other aspects. But, eventually, I would really like to have just one system I maintain and use in both places. Ideally, in the same repo: currently, the sources for both are separate, and this makes it harder to maintain things or deploy things simultaneously.

If only I had more time! My current paid time off is running out, but I am already planning to return to this idea of rewriting everything at the end of December.

I need to still find a way to somehow keep the old setup alongside the new one, as it is likey impossible to (quickly) migrate _everything_ from the old system to the new one. So what I am planning is to try and make it possible to _merge_ both, and keep the old posts rendered with the old system, while allow writing new posts with Astro. We’ll see if it will work out!

I guess, this was a much less useful post for anyone reading, but I really want to just document — even if for myself — the process of me working on my website.
