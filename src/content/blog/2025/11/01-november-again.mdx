For the third time, I am attempting to write a blog post for every day of November. I managed to do it for 2023 and 2024. I won’t promise I’ll manage to post every day this time, but I’ll try.

## Apple Annie

I was not sure if I will do this attempt, but when thinking about the coming November, I couldn’t stop thinking about [Anne Sturdivant](https://web.archive.org/web/20241214222059/https://anniegreens.lol/) [who passed at the beginning of this year](https://neatnik.net/remembering-anne-sturdivant/) (post by [Adam Newbold](https://adam.omg.lol/) — thanks for letting us know), and who was the constant presence for this challenge for the last years.

Annie was an inspiration, and I loved how many different topics she covered in her blogs. I mentioned her posts and experiments five times in my blog, and I am endlessly sad that no new posts of her will be mentioned here.

But I will try to at least continue doing this challenge: even though it was always very tough, it was always _productive_. For me, that challenge will now always be associated with Annie.

## Burnout

I did not write about CSS a lot this year, right? Neither on my main site, nor in this blog. And I did not do many new experiments.

I am a perfectionist, and often it feels like, sometimes, I care too much about what I do. And then, when I expect the same care from others, and find that it is just not there, it can hurt.

My debt of spoons is big, and it is hard to find strength for doing anything.

So many drafts, so many of them are not finished, not published, covered by digital dust, crumbled in a corner between dropped anime series and unfinished video games.

My hope is that having to post each day of this month will at least produce _something_.

## The Plan

I have a big backlog of stuff I want to write about, but I also created a list of what I could write about this month specifically. I won’t post it here, but here is what I will _try_ to do:

- Every weekend I will post something non-CSS related: more personal notes, thoughts, maybe game reviews? We’ll see.
- Weekdays will be for more front-end related stuff. CSS. Maybe something else. Maybe will do some more work on this blog and post some dev logs?

Other than that, I don’t think I will follow any specific structure. I hope that on the weekends I could manage start writing drafts for some of the future November posts, just so I will be not as pressed to do so on the actual days.

I want to say and write even more now that I started — as it often happens with me. The hardest thing is to begin, then words start flowing.

## Thank You

If you read this post — thank you. Sometimes it feels that the internet of old is gone. But anyone who has it in them to read random musings of people on the web contributes to the idea of independent network.

And if you’ll want to write a few more posts than usual this November — send them my way, regardless of the topic — I’ll be happy to read them.
