description: 'Today I’ll share my observation that I initially wanted to work more on, but just had to get out sooner rather than later: we can use the `currentColor` inside `color-mix()`! And with that, we could modify an alpha channel of a color only with CSS.'

This post is sponsored by the second-to-last day of the month, and me not knowing what to write.

In frantic search for a topic, I remembered one thing I was keeping slightly under wraps — mostly because I wanted to do more experiments with it, probably fill more bugs, and, as usual, polish-polish-polish. But the whole idea of me trying to write more “observations” is to get away from it!

So, today I’ll share my observation: we can use the `currentColor` inside `color-mix()`! But only after I’ll share how we can modify the alpha channel of a color by using them.

Sounds simple enough and, maybe, obvious, but it works, look:

<LiveExample caption="A live example showing how we can modify the alpha channel of a color.">
```css
.context {
	color: hotpink;
}
.test {
	color: color-mix(
		in srgb,
		currentColor 50%,
		transparent
	);
}
```
```html
<div class="context">
	<p>This is a very pink text.</p>
	<p class="test">And this one has 50% opacity.</p>
</div>
```
</LiveExample>

Right away, before I would explain what’s going on, I need to link to two things:

1. The [“Emulate basic relative color syntax with `color-mix()` + the `none` keyword”](https://codepen.io/leaverou/pen/gOZZQZb?editors=1100) by [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) — I did already mention it twice on this blog. This is the third time!

2. [This Mastodon post](https://social.lol/@anniegreens/111480483490758075) by [Anne Sturdivant](https://anniegreens.lol/), in which she did, inadvertently, solved an issue I was trying to work around for some time.

Lea’s CodePen was about how we can use `color-mix()` and mix colors that have `none` for some color stops.

For a while, I was trying to do the same, but only for adjusting the alpha component of a color, like this:

<LiveExample caption="A live example that attempts the same as the previous one, but at the moment of writing fails almost everywhere." shouldHideHTML>
```css
.test-broken {
	color: color-mix(
		in srgb,
		currentColor 0%,
		rgba(none none none / 50%)
	);
}
```
```html
<div class="context">
	<p>This is a very pink text.</p>
	<p class="test-broken">And this one should have 50% opacity.</p>
</div>
```
</LiveExample>

But that doesn’t work anywhere, really (I’ve yet to fill a bug for one of the cases). Or this:

<LiveExample caption="A similar live example that uses a different color space, and currently fails only in Chrome." shouldHideHTML>
```css
.test-broken2 {
	color: color-mix(
		in oklch,
		currentColor 0%,
		oklch(none none none / 50%)
	);
}
```
```html
<div class="context">
	<p>This is a very pink text.</p>
	<p class="test-broken2">And this one should have 50% opacity.</p>
</div>
```
</LiveExample>

This works in Firefox, works in Safari, but doesn’t in Chrome.

I even went to write web platform tests for that one (it was before I found out about the above issue), and they were merged, but! That’s still an ongoing thing, I’ll probably write about it at some point later.

Regardless. Now we can do this!

<LiveExample caption="The same live example as the first one on this page." shouldHideHTML>
```css
.test {
	color: color-mix(
		in srgb,
		currentColor 50%,
		transparent
	);
}
```
```html
<div class="context">
	<p>This is a very pink text.</p>
	<p class="test">And this one has 50% opacity.</p>
</div>
```
</LiveExample>

It is the same example as the first one, and it should work everywhere.

The crucial parts:

1. We should use `srgb`. Other color spaces do not work the same for some reason (again — would probably need to investigate further — do you see how I’d want to spend more time on this instead of just writing about it?)

2. We should use `transparent`, and instead of having the alpha component there, we use the percentage with the first color!

Now — we can use this method to adjust (srgb) colors, and get their versions with alpha channel modified! All thanks to Lea and Anne!

## Wait About CurrentColor?

I think I did sidetrack a bit. The other thing I wanted to share: that we can do this not just with some color, even if it comes from a CSS variable, but with a `currentColor`, even when used with `color` property!

Long story short: this works the same way as `font-size: 2em`. The `em` mentioned inside `font-size` is the _inherited_ value of the font-size, and in the same way, `currentColor` mentioned inside the `color` is the _inherited_ color.

I would really want to play with this a bit more, maybe involve `@property` in some way to see how things would behave with it, but I did promise myself that I need to learn when to stop — and here I am, doing this.

The browser support for `color-mix()` might seem pretty good, _however_, as you could see from all the issues around color spaces and mixing — it might not be _as stable as we might think_. I’ll be cautious before using this in production seriously, there will need to be a lot of testing, and a lot of cross-browser testing.

A [quick test](https://codepen.io/kizu/pen/LYqBZXB) that I did with this shows that Safari, Firefox and Chrome all render something in it differently except for the `srgb` with `transparent` method, which, I think, we _could_ cautiously start trying.

But even if this is still unstable — I really encourage you to experiment with this. Try other color modes, try other ways to mix things up — and give your feedback to browsers! `color-mix()` is very powerful, and the sooner it will become stable, the better for everyone.
