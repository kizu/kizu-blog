On the horizon it is possible to see the skyscrapers of the La Défense, just some high buildings, and a very faint silhouette of the Eiffel Tower, followed by a hill of Mont Valérien. The sky is blue, but with many white and grey clouds, with the horizon in the shade, but the sun lighting the area up to the foreground."
