            "alt": "A photo of a person walking a bit uphill near a road. Behind them, an old brick building, painted white, with a courtyard separated by a wall with two green doors: for people, and for cars. On a side of that building, there is a small round oriel window with ornamental decorations under it, and faded graffiti below. On the two-lane road, there is a small safety island in the middle with a back of some sign. The right of the photo is framed by a streetlamp and some green leaves of trees. The left of the photo is covered by red, with a bit of green out-of-focus leaves."
