There are also bright-green leaves on the branches, and on the right there are some reddish leaves from a different tree visible. Behind the fence and the trees there is an out of focus old-looking building with shingles and chimneys. The top of the fence in front is also covered with large shingles, and the white paint on its wall is a bit dilapidated."
