This is a very quick shout-out to the [Bridgy Fed](https://fed.brid.gy/) project by [Ryan Barrett](https://snarfed.org/).

Its goal is to connect people across otherwise unrelated federated network: [Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse), [Bluesky](https://bsky.social/about), and even [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) sites.

After the exodus from more corporate and capitalist networks, people ended up in different parts of the web. Each segment could be well-connected inside, but if you want to participate _everywhere_ where people are now, you often need to create and maintain multiple accounts.

I often see people reposting the same thing in multiple places — which is fine, but not everyone has the spoons to do so. Not everyone is also ready to create an account in a network they do not understand or do not like.

That’s where Bridgy can really help: it is the _easiest_ and most straightforward way to connect your account to other networks.

- If you’re on Mastodon or elsewhere in the Fediverse and want to make it possible for people from Bluesky to follow you, you can either [log in with your account here](https://fed.brid.gy/login) or just follow the `@bsky.brid.gy@bsky.brid.gy` account from your client (you can use search to find it there via its handle).

- If you’re on Bluesky, and want to make it possible for people on Mastodon and the Fediverse at large to follow you, you can either [log in with your account here](https://fed.brid.gy/login), or just follow [@ap.brid.gy](https://bsky.app/profile/ap.brid.gy) from Bluesky.

That’s it. Bridgy works as opt-in — nothing is bridged without your consent, and by default it will only bridge your public posts.

Here is, for example, [my bridged account on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/kizu.front-end.social.ap.brid.gy), where the posts from [my Mastodon profile](https://front-end.social/@kizu) go automatically.

And here is [my bridged Pixey (Pixelfed instance) account](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:jz4h5jq5ksajcp5ysqp6id5z) where the photos from [my Pixey gallery](https://pixey.org/kizu) go.

Bridgy even handles replies, DMs, and more. It is zero maintenance, and there is zero reason not to use it.

If you know people who are only present on one of the networks and are not bridging their accounts — nudge them to do so!

The more interconnected our web is, the more powerful it is. I find it awesome that vastly different networks can talk to each other thanks to projects like that.
