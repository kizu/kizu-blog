            "alt": "A photo of a short arc-shaped tunnel with brick walls. The road is narrow, and is enough for only one car, with two pedestrian walkways on each side: the left one is wider than a narrow right one. The front of the tunnel is framed with green vines and tree branches, some of which has white flowers on them. After the tunnel, a few trees are visible, blossoming with pink flowers, as well as a few buildings and cars. Before the tunnel is all in shade, but further in the tunnel there is light, with the sun making a bright spot on one of the tunnel's walls."
