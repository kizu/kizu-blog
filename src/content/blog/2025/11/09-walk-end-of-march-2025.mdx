I am a bit out of it — did not sleep for quite a while, but not managing to fall asleep properly now. Staying in Europe and not going to this year’s [TPAC](https://www.w3.org/2025/11/TPAC/), I am trying to shift my waking hours to match Japan. Not very successfully so far.

Well, time to repost some older photos from Pixelfed!

This was at the end of this March, when trees started to get their leaves, and blooming with flowers.

Weather was pretty nice that day: sunny, with some clouds. There were a bunch of people in the parks.

![People walking in the parks.](pixelfed:817864172297932484)

I went a long way, intending to get a tram back. Passed between the viaduct with the tram line on top, and noticed some houses nested under it.

Went pretty randomly, through some parks I never visited before.

![A lot of activity in the park.](pixelfed:818175015462030871)

Ended up going onto some hill with a dead end, but managed to find a private (but open) path between properties.

I did not manage to make many good photos: I was still getting used to the wider lens, and unlike when I was in the forest, it was a bit harder to get good shots.

![Someone's yard.](pixelfed:818556849380953329)

Funnily enough, the tram did not work that day, and some of the closest bus stops were closed because of some construction. Well.

![A tunnel.](pixelfed:818821045448530424)

In the end, I just walked all the back home, and tested a nice hill climb with a staircase.

That’s it. I’ll now go drink some tea, eat some food, and try to go sleep for a while.
