I am back with reposting some of my old photos from my Pixelfed, but now in my blog. I did not fix the API issue that prevented me from doing it the last time, but made a workaround that worked well enough.

Curiously, the first two images from this post can illustrate what I was talking a week ago in my [“Preparing Images For Pixelfed”](/preparing-images-for-pixelfed/) post.

The first image from this series was published before I saw the issue with the color profiles and resizing/recompression:

![A blossoming tree.](pixelfed:819141881473275029)

It has a bit of a flatter profile than what I inteded to have, and is not as sharp as it could be.

After this image, I changed my workflow, and here is, hopefully, the quality of photos that I’ll try to post from this point on (unless I will report some of the older ones, of course):

![](pixelfed:819153360222415327)

If the last two posts that I shared had photos made with the 17mm prime lens, this time I went to the opposite side: I bought a second-hand lens from [MPB](https://www.mpb.com/en-eu) — Olympus M.Zuiko 75mm f/1.8.

Before that, my favorite lens was the 45mm one, but I think fell in love with this lens after my first walk with it. I really like to hunt for details, and I am fascinated by the out-of-focus rendering this lens produces.

![](pixelfed:819278910423709262)

This metal lens is pretty big for Micro Four Thirds, and is quite heavy: a bit more than 300g. Initially, I thought that it would not be as comfortable as other lenses on my OM-3, which doesn’t have the best grip, but at some point I stopped noticing it.

![Over the wall.](pixelfed:819494172167603910)

This time I went first to the park, then with a goal to go down the hill to the Seine and then back.

I am usually shy, and try to avoid being obvious when shooting people, but this lens really allows being very far away, not feel like you intrude, and catch some nice small scenes.

![In the park.](pixelfed:819541955625184588)

The next photo, especially with that crop, demonstrates the background compression that 75mm — 150mm equivalent on full frame — can achieve. This is the edge of the terrace, with the [La Défense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_D%C3%A9fense) in the background, around ten kilometers afar.

Scyscrapers? They look nice in the distance, but that’s it. I would rather be closer to the tiny buildings like this one:

![I wonder what’s there inside](pixelfed:819867772992844044)

And closer to these fellows as well:

![](pixelfed:819967576422198838)

In this park there are always people, and there is always someone standing there at the edge and marvelling the views.

![People on the terrace.](pixelfed:820389313083538965)

Though, some are not that interested in them.

![Dog.](pixelfed:820588499458032038)

Going through the park, I started to go down the hill. One notable thing there is this pavillon visible:

![With not that old buildings behind it.](pixelfed:821117008784231809)

The telephoto lens makes it possible to catch some nice details, like the statues in this pavillon’s garden with maze hedges.

![](pixelfed:821724817813925020)

The views are very nice both on the terrace, and on the way down: bridges, trees, old buildings, a lot of things to look at.

![A Bridge.](pixelfed:822133773384805105)

Not that many people walk this way, uphill or downhill. I once went there, and the path is generally pleasant.

![](pixelfed:822373303163935317)

There are many ways down, and I used the one I chose for the second time, as the last time I saw a bunch of squirrels there. This time I also saw them, but did not manage to make any good photos, oops.

![Another dog!](pixelfed:822552199670131734)

It is always nice down by the river, although, while 75mm is nice, it is just barely enough to catch some birds there: would need a much more powerful lens for that. But not sure if I want one.

![](pixelfed:822748381239615063)

The riverbank is pretty diverse, with boardwaks, pathways, etc. It is rather nice there.

![A boardwalk.](pixelfed:823183116530453393)

The river is wide, there are islands on it, with trees almost falling into the water.

![](pixelfed:823539067871018024)

Some tall trees on the other side, and some tiny trees on this one.

![Green grass.](pixelfed:824020465917189949)

And some dinosaurs swimming in the river.

![](pixelfed:824343465583386512)

Managed to catch this composition in the end, with the lens allowing to get it without too much cropping.

![A rectangle.](pixelfed:824654970090378003)

That’s it for now! I don’t have other full photo walks I did afterwards, but I have a lot of older photos that I will be slowly publishing, so it is likely the next photo posts will have photos from my older camera and lenses.
