## Table of Contents

## Quick Update

I’ve spent most of the day inside the delayed and cancelled trains (thanks, Deutsche Bahn). I did not have an opportunity to come up with a good post for today, but both yesterday (and a bit today) I hacked on this blog, as a part of the IndieWebCamp.

I did the thing I wanted to do during this weekend: update my blog’s Table of Contents to be similar to what I have on my [main site](https://kizu.dev/). Actually, it was already working like that, but only in Chrome.

## What I Had

What I am talking about: the small finger marker that appears in the Table of Contents, pointing to the current section:

import demoVideo from './_demo.mp4';
import demoPoster from './demo.jpg';

<Video src={demoVideo} poster={demoPoster} caption="The list marker is replaced with a pointing hand symbol for a ToC item when its section is on the screen." />

Before this update, it worked only in Chrome: I was using a heavily modified variation of [my scroll-driven animations experiment](https://kizu.dev/scroll-driven-animations/#table-ofcontents-with-highlighted-current-sections) for scroll markers.

## The Update

Now — it is all the same, but also works in Firefox and Safari!

All thanks to some JS, delivered via a custom element. This is something I briefly mentioned in [my CSS Day talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZC_WS05t2lI): instead of trying to cover the whole technology, like scroll-driven animations, with a polyfill, we can only [ponyfill](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ponyfill) a single technique with a custom element and implement only the missing parts.

This is what I did: the technique requires scroll-driven animations, particularly, `timeline-scope`, which Firefox Nightly does not yet support in its outdated experimental implementation of them.

I used an intersection observer and a window resize event to implement what is missing, while keeping most of the styles intact.

I won’t go into the details of the implementation today. Maybe the code behind it could be polished and published as a package? Maybe, one day. Maybe, not. Let me know.

If you’re interested at peeking at the source code of this (far from polished, but at least with some comments), here it is:

- [CSS](https://github.com/kizu/kizu-blog/blob/main/src/styles/features/scroll-markers.css)
- [Astro component with the custom element inside](https://github.com/kizu/kizu-blog/blob/main/src/components/ScrollMarkers.astro)

## The Specs

Interestingly, [Robert Flack](https://github.com/flackr) opened a [CSSWG issue](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/10720) about scroll-markers as a part of the work they did alongside [Miriam Suzanne](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/) and [Nicole Sullivan](https://www.stubbornella.org/) on the “carousels” — [“CSS Overflow - Broad Research”](https://css.oddbird.net/overflow/explainer/).

With it, things like that will become _trivial_, and I cannot wait for it to be specified and in the browsers.
