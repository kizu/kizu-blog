## CSS Articles and News

There was not a lot of stuff this week on the CSS part, probably due to the Thanksgiving and all of that. But still something!

- [“An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid”](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) by [Josh W. Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) — I always loved the way Josh explains things, and even though I did not have an opportunity to go through his new guide completely, what I saw has all the usual good bits: interactive examples and good examples.
- [“`@scope` MDN docs”](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@scope) by [Chris Mills](https://millsdocs.com/) — comprehensive docs about CSS scopes, talking about its various features and nuances.
- [“`oklch()` retains perceived lightness for different hue angles”](https://www.stefanjudis.com/today-i-learned/oklch-perceived-lightness/) by [Stefan Judis](https://www.stefanjudis.com/) — a little exploration of how OKLCH handles the change in hue, with a nice interactive demo.
- [“Scroll Timeline Parallax Effect”](https://css-irl.info/scroll-timeline-parallax-effect/) by [Michelle Barker](https://michellebarker.co.uk/) — a small experiment that demonstrates how we can use scroll-driven animations to achieve the parallax effect in CSS.

## Typograhy and Design

Continuing the “tradition” of including one more topic apart from CSS in my weekly, this time it contains some typography and design links.

- [“Minimalist Affordances: Making the right tradeoffs”](https://lea.verou.me/blog/2023/minimalist-affordances/) by [Lea Verou](https://lea.verou.me/) — an article about the usability of the new GitHub comment UI, where they did try to move the focus outline around the whole comment block, including other interactive elements inside. I think they might’ve gone back on this decision since? Nevertheless, the post is a pleasant read anyway, exploring the ways things become conventions.
- [“The Monaspace type system”](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) by [Lettermatic and GitHub Next](https://github.com/githubnext/monaspace#contributors) — a new “monospaced type superfamily”. It uses an interesting and novel technique of “texture healing”, where the contextual alternates are used to adjust the position and form of the characters in a monospace context. The adjustment of the form is what differentiates it from the regular kerning. I first heard about the [Lettermatic](https://lettermatic.com/) studio from their work on [Pentiment game](https://pentiment.obsidian.net/) by [Obsidian Entertainment](https://www.obsidian.net/), where they did also do a lot of innovative work with the fonts. I can highly recommend both reading [their case study about this](https://lettermatic.com/custom/pentiment) and the game itself.
- [“It’s 2023, here is why your web design sucks”](https://heather-buchel.com/blog/2023/10/why-your-web-design-sucks/) by [Heather Buchel](https://heather-buchel.com/) — an evocative article about how the profession of “web designer” dissolved in the industry. My experience was slightly different, but there were still enough similarities, and it is always fascinating to look at how things evolved differently in other places.
- [“Practical Typography”](https://practicaltypography.com/) by [Matthew Butterick](https://matthewbutterick.com/) — an online book (free, but payment is encouraged) about typography. It was recommended to me in [a Mastodon thread where I asked for some typography book recommendations](https://front-end.social/@kizu/111471970521106424), and going through a few sections of it, there are things to like.
- [“The Nevermore: The Collected Works of
Edgar Allan Poe”](https://nevermore.rip/) by [Joshua
Mauldin](https://joshuamauldin.com/) — a good example of applying typography to the web in practice. Maybe one day I’ll actually read some of it!

## My Blog Posts

Between the [last “weekly”](/weekly-bookmarks-005/) and this one were six days, so this section has six links today (yes, this is the same paragraph text as in the previous weekly; probably for the last time, as next week the November ends, and with it my venture into posting every day):
