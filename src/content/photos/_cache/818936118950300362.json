            "alt": "A photo of a stair path from a steep incline, with many houses between the trees visible down below on the horizon in the background. The sun is soon to be set, and it lights up brightly the scene. There are walls on both sides of the path, with an opening on the right. A woman is sitting with her phone in the opening. Trees are visible on the left, behind the wall — a few green branches of a pine or a spruce, and orange leaves of some other trees. Some other small details in the shot: a low streetlamp near the stairs, a couple of people barely visible descending them, some signs, a house near a way visible through the opening, and an antenna on top of its roof."
