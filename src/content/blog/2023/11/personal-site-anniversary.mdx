Today is the 22nd anniversary of my first HTML page on the web: November 4th, 2001. Quite a long time going!

Initially, I wanted to post a longer history of my personal website(s), but looking at all the archives, that would be a much longer task, especially if I would like to show the screenshots and examples of what I had. For now, I’ve decided to write a shorter post.

## Some Interesting Notes

In the beginning, it was a non-technical, childish site; I moved from one free hosting provider to another in 2001 and “redesigned” that site, I think, eight times? Not counting the not-finished designs.

In 2008, I purchased my first domain and started a technical blog, which evolved over time into what we can currently see at https://kizu.dev

Here is the beginning of the timeline for my personal site and my history with the web.

### 2001

- Before I did start working on my site (I think on November 1st, so it was done rather quickly), I did touch HTML _a little_ during the summer school in June the same year. There was a project for a photo gallery to burn on a CD, with the gallery being made with JS. I think I did mostly content management there, but that exposure was probably what led to me creating my website (as well as a website dedicated to Baldur’s Gate from a school friend).

- My first site was on the [framesets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/frameset)!

- Here is the full HTML of the `index.htm` that I had:

	```html
	<html><head><title>Kizmarh's Cave</title></head>
	<frameset rows="74,*" border=0><frame src="menu.htm" name="menu" noresize>
	<frame src="news.htm" name="document" noresize></frameset></html>
	```

- I won’t show you the content of the frames themselves, but there were _tables_. As in, using tables for the page layout. This would stay for the whole journey of my nontechnical site (I stopped working on it somewhere around 2006).

- There was no CSS, not even inline styles.

### 2002

- My first redesign and hosting change!

- Framesets were gone, but tables did stay.

- I used JS to implement images changing on hover via inline events:

	```html
	onmouseover='document.qqq.src="mpic2.gif"' onmouseout='document.qqq.src="mpic.gif"'
	```

- Later the same year, I rewrote that site to be an SPA. Yes. Just one page, where I did change the content of the sections via JS. But hey, I did also write my first line of CSS: `overflow:auto` as an inline style!

- That version of the site had “Best viewed in Internet Explorer”.

- I think this version of the site did participate in a contest and won first place. I would not give _that_ the first place today.

### 2003

- I ditched SPA and kept things simple.

- Every page had a different design, and I used [image maps](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/map) in a few places!

- There was still no new CSS on the personal site itself.

- _However_, looking through the archives of my files, I found some of my earlier experiments with CSS, from October 26. Here is how I wrote an external stylesheet, then. It’s pretty, isn’t it?

	```css
	body {background:      #000000;
	      font:            11pt/14pt Serif;
	      color:           #FFFFFF}

	a    {text-decoration: none;
	      color:           #BBBBBB}
	```

- And here is, as you could tell, my first _CSS experiment_: masking an e-mail against spambots (with a more modern e-mail):

	```html
	<p style="font:11pt/0pt Courier">
	k&nbsp;z&nbsp;a&nbsp;h&nbsp;g&nbsp;a&nbsp;l&nbsp;c&nbsp;m<br>
	&nbsp;i&nbsp;m&nbsp;r&nbsp;@&nbsp;m&nbsp;i&nbsp;.&nbsp;o&nbsp;
	</p>
	```

	It still works!

	<figure>
		<p style="font:11pt/0pt Courier">k&nbsp;z&nbsp;a&nbsp;h&nbsp;g&nbsp;a&nbsp;l&nbsp;c&nbsp;m<br/>&nbsp;i&nbsp;m&nbsp;r&nbsp;@&nbsp;m&nbsp;i&nbsp;.&nbsp;o&nbsp;</p>
		<figcaption>
			A live example that _looks_ like normal text, but actually contains gibberish, like when trying to copy it, or access in any non-visual way.
		</figcaption>
	</figure>

	I don’t think I ever used this in production — at some point I just started using the unmasked e-mails and did not notice a bump in the volume of spam.

- Later in December, I did create my LiveJournal account.

### 2004

- Two more redesigns of the personal site, still nothing new there.

- I think I did work a bit on a website for my Mom’s job. I don’t remember any context, and there is a chance I first did it in 2001, but I don’t believe the file timestamps, as the site did already contain some CSS, which did not look like something I would write in 2001. But it looks more fitting for 2004.

- I started doing my first LiveJournal themes, customizing them via [S1 overrides](https://www.livejournal.com/support/faq/124.html). You could add custom HTML and CSS to your “social network profile” then!

### 2005

- I redesigned my personal site once again, but it was still using tables.

- However, I made the design of the pages fully responsive! Before that, I used fixed layouts, now it was a `<table>` with `width=100% height=100%`.

- I started practicing a bit more with CSS, probably closer to the end of the year. One thing I did was rewrite one random web page’s layout from tables to floats and absolute positioning. It also had text-shadows made by using duplicate content and `z-index`.

### 2006

- I did not update my personal site.

- I was mostly doing the themes for LiveJournal.

- December 26: I decided to read the CSS2.1 specs in full.

### 2007

- January: I started working officially as a full-time front-end web developer.

### 2008

- February: I published my first technical website on a personal domain.

## To Be Continued!

Sadly, it seems that while for some older files the timestamps are intact, for anything starting from 2006 there are not a lot of correct ones. Maybe if I could find a proper archive somewhere that did retain everything…

In 2006, I was not in a good place closer to the end of the year, quitting the university and feeling quite worthless overall. I was lucky to finally land a job and start working as a developer full-time. Things have gotten much better since then for me. I’m happy where I am now (internally; externally… not so much).

Maybe one day I will revisit this post — or write a new one — and update this timeline, adding new notes and maybe adding examples of some of my earlier experiments or LiveJournal themes. Sharing funny snippets of code here and there.

If you have your own personal website, when did you start it? How did it evolve? I think it might be interesting to revisit your old code and your old self sometimes. I would be interested in reading more people’s stories about how they started their journey with the web platform.
