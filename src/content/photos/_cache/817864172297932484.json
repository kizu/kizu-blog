Further away on the path, there is a little girl on a pink bicycle. Even further there is a playground and another person can be barely seen there. There is a lot of green in the photo: grass and leaves, and the sun is shining brightly, leaving many shadows. The sky is mostly clear, with a single cloud barely visible."
