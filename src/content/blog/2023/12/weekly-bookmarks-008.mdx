I did not have a lot of time to read stuff outside my CSS comfort zone this week, so, once again, mostly CSS-related links.

## My Experiments

- [“The Shrinkwrap Problem: Possible Future Solutions”](https://kizu.dev/shrinkwrap-problem/) — last Thursday I published a new larger article.

    Anchor positioning, once again, solving one of the hardest CSS problems! Not for all the cases, but enough that when we will finally get it in all browsers, this will be a really useful technique.

- [“A Peek Into the CSS Lab”](https://www.meetup.com/css-cafe/events/297788668/) — next Thursday I’ll talk about some of my experiments at [CSS Café](https://www.meetup.com/css-cafe/).

    6:00 PM CET, online, free. Everyone is welcome!

## CSS Articles and News

- [“Baseline’s evolution on MDN”](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/baseline-evolution-on-mdn/) by [Vadim Makeev](https://pepelsbey.dev/) — a short article about the changes in the Baseline and how it will be displayed on MDN pages.

- [“A definition update for Baseline”](https://web.dev/blog/baseline-definition-update) by [Rachel Andrew](https://rachelandrew.co.uk/), [Kadir Topal](https://github.com/atopal), and [André Cipriani Bandarra](https://bandarra.me/) — a similar post about the Baseline update by the Google team.

- [“CSS Wrapped: 2023!”](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-wrapped-2023) by [Una Kravets](https://una.im/), [Bramus](https://www.bram.us/), and [Adam Argyle](https://nerdy.dev/) — an extensive overview of many new features in CSS that Chrome did ship this year. Plenty of nice demos!

- [“Media Queries in HTML Video”](https://adrianroselli.com/2023/12/media-queries-in-html-video.html) by [Adrian Roselli](https://adrianroselli.com/) — a good exploration of various ways we could now use the `<video>` element that adapts to various media features.

- [“Oh no! My JSON!”](https://www.tonymottaz.com/blog/oh-no-my-json/) by [Tony Mottaz](https://www.tonymottaz.com/) — a short post, reminding that not all small “progressive enhancement”-like features like `hanging-punctuation` should be applied to _everything_. Similar to `text-wrap: balance`, it is better to scope it to places you will sure need it.

- [“Three Decades of HTML”](https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2023/12/06/three-decades-of-html/) by [Eric Meyer](https://meyerweb.com/) — a short post about how Eric wrote his first HTML document. I really like these kinds of posts: I did write a similar post around a month ago — [“Personal Site Anniversary & History”](/personal-site-anniversary/).

- [“12 Days of Web”](https://12daysofweb.dev/) curated by [Stephanie Eckles](https://thinkdobecreate.com/) — starting from the next Wednesday, for twelve days, there will be one new article about the web platform posted every day. For now, if you’re wondering what there was in the previous years, I recommend to check out the archives: [2022](https://12daysofweb.dev/2022/) and [2021](https://12daysofweb.dev/2021/).
