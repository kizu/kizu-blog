Not always something I find has obvious use cases, and not always I have the time to write a proper long and polished article like I do on [my main site](https://kizu.dev/).

However, how many interesting things I did stumble upon and did not share in pursuit of perfectionism?

This is the category where I try limiting the amount of time I spend on polishing the post, and just let it out.
