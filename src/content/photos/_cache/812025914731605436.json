Further beyond, there is a drop and many houses going until the horizon covered in slight haze or smog.\n\nOn the wall, there is a sign with the following text: Ministere de la culture.\nDirection du patrimoine.\nDomaine national de St-Germain-en-Laye.\n\nThere are three icons visible: two that allow dogs (but with leashes) and bicycles (with reduced speed), and one that disallows picnics."
