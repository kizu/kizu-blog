I have a big backlog of photos, and now that I have an ability to embed them in my blog, I will occasionally do so!

I am initially posting them on Pixelfed, and this post was [originally published there](https://pixey.org/i/web/post/785237288622073118). Pixelfed is cool, maybe you should join it, and post photos there, and not _somewhere else_. If you’re publishing them on your site — reposting them on Pixelfed could also be a good idea.

Anyways.

On December 25 of last year, on the next day after publishing my latest article — [“Indirect Cyclic Conditions: Prototyping Parametrized CSS Mixins”](https://kizu.dev/indirect-cyclic-conditions/) — I went for a walk in a nearby park.

It is usually hard for me to go outside, but I got this habit recently: after I finish an article, I just try to go for a walk. Either on the same day, or the next one. This led to [my Pixelfed account](https://pixey.org/i/web/profile/546076540786363642) having a bit more photos than usual in the last few months!

This time, there was another reason to go and take some photos — I bought myself a new lens. I am using an [Olympus OM-D E-M5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_OM-D_E-M5) Camera — the Micro Four Thirds one from 2012.

Usually, I use the Olympus M.Zuiko Digital 45mm f/1.8 lens, but this was my first time trying their 25mm version. It was nice, although I got too used to the 45mm one.

It was a nice walk, during twilight, after the sunset. I think, the park was closing soon, but hey, the gates were open, and there were people still inside, so I did sneak in for a bit.

The park is near [Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau_de_Saint-Germain-en-Laye) and has a long terrace that overlooks the towns below that stretch up to Paris on the horizon.

There were either low clouds, or fog, or smog on the horizon — usually it is possible to see the Eiffel Tower there, on the right from [La Défense](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_D%C3%A9fense). This time you couldn’t see them.

But at this time you could see the city with the night lights starting to appear here and there, with cars driving on the bridge over the Seine somewhere below. It was a pleasant evening.
