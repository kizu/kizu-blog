If you have read any posts in this blog, you might’ve noticed the “Current music” field at the top. This is something I adopted back from [when I was using LiveJournal](/lj-20-years/). Some of the apps that allowed posting there supported a way to detect what is currently playing in your audio player (likely, [Winamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winamp)). Or maybe there was even a [last.fm](https://www.last.fm/) integration?

Anyways, that was fun! When I [started this blog](https://blog.kizu.dev/not-an-ideal-start/), one of the reasons was because of the nostalgia for these times, and that’s why I added the “Current music” metadata field, and why I am filling it manually for every post I write here.

Until today, it was displayed just as a string. Today, I made it into a proper “category”: if I shared some artist more than once, its name will become a link to the list of all posts that share it. Why? Well, why not?

I already have some ideas over how I could improve this. For example, it would be nice for every artist who appears twice or more, to add some info over on their category page, with links to their official pages, bandcamps and whatnot.

So, yeah. I listen to a lot of music, of many genres, and I always wanted to share some of it a bit wider. This could be a good way to start doing so! And if you’re curious more about my tastes — feel free to peek over at [my last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/ki_zu). I “scrobble” what I’m listening to for over 18 years now, wow.

This post’s “Current music”, if you’re curious, is from the band that I listened the most to when I started using last.fm in 2006. One member of this band sang the vocal parts for the main character in [Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beck_(manga)) anime — I found this band through it.
