            "alt": "A photo of a path, going in a slight curve a bit uphill. The path consists of large white stone squares visible from between the grass. On the left there is a hedge, on the right and forwards there are brick fences. Behind the forward fence there are trees and bushes, with two small chimneys visible. The sun is shining brightly, the shadow of a stone fence on the right covers most of the path and creates angled ridges from its slight change in elevation."
