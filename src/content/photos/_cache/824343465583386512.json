            "alt": "A photo of a great cormorant, swimming in a river. Only a head with a bit of a neck is visible, evidently just emerged from the water after a dive. There is a bit of a yellow on its cheeky, curvy beak. The water has ripples all over it from the wind, and there is a visible set of smaller ripples left by the bird. The photo is mostly monotone, with the yellow on the bird's head being a slightly more bright spot."
