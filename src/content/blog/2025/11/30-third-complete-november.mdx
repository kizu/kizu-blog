For the third time, third year in a row, I managed to write a post for every day of November.

I was tired at the end, and postponed writing many posts until the end of the day, but it felt easier than the last two previous years.

The hardest part was: I decided not to post about CSS or frontend on weekends, and I ended up with more notes for what to write about CSS, and couldn’t find many topics for non-CSS posts.

However, I still did write some CSS on weekends.

Anyways, I don’t think the quality of the posts was that good, but it is _better than nothing_, right? The necessity to write posts was nice as a way to push myself to actually publish stuff.

I won’t go through all the posts that I wrote about CSS, but will recommend you check out these three if you missed them:

- [“Fixing Baselines”](/fixing-baselines/) — a small technique that I used for a very long time, and finally found an opportunity to write about.

- [“Inline Custom Identifiers”](/inline-custom-identifiers/) — a post about an approach to naming things and connecting them to other elements that require unique identifiers in CSS via inline custom properties.

- [“Anchoring to a Containing Block”](/anchoring-to-a-containing-block/) — the way to fix a very common anchor positioning issue that I stumble over and over again.

I also wrote a few posts about some of the design tweaks I ended up using for my blog and website through the iteration over the years:

- [“Uneven Inline Paddings”](/uneven-inline-paddings/) — usually a not noticeable thing to visually balance the left-ragged text.

- [“Styles For Secondary Interactive Elements”](/styles-for-secondary-interactive-elements/) — a more noticeable thing, which I don’t see people using often.

- [“Bolder Links”](/bolder-links/) — a more subtle thing I do for around two years.

There are more posts that I could write about, but I think I’ll stop. Usually, in these last few years, I do a roundup of things I did for the whole year, and I will likely write about some of them there.

The best part: I have more notes about CSS than I could write about. Many of those topics were a tiny bit too big for a quick daily post, so I hope I will manage to start writing and publishing them over time.

And there is also one big article that I started writing, but did not manage to finish, partially because some of my time was dedicated to those daily posts. But — I for sure want to finish and publish this article in December. It should be a pretty good one, I think.

See you next month.
