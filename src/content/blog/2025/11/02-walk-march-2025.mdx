Well… It is November, but I am sharing photos from my walk from this March. I already published them on my Pixelfed account almost right after taking them, but I really want to continue posting them here as well.

![A nice spring day](pixelfed:809179867247976916)

This was my first walk with both a new camera, and a new lens:

- Camera is [OM System OM-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OM_System_OM-3).
- Lens is OM System M.Zuiko Digital 17mm f/1.8 II.

If you don’t know — “OM System” is the brand name for [the company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OM_Digital_Solutions) that bought Olympus camera division, so they basically continuing doing the same: releasing new cameras and lenses for [micro four thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Four_Thirds_system) system.

My last camera — [Olympus OM-D E-M5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympus_OM-D_E-M5) — was released in 2012, and I bought it for myself in 2013. I don’t often upgrade my gear!

This lens is now the widest lens I have, although in full frame equivalent it is not as wide — it would be 34mm there.

But, for me, it _is_ wide: my favorite lens before that was 45mm in micro four thirds, so a 90mm equivalent.

I am not that used to this wide of an aperture, but I was glad that I went into the forest — unlike my past lens that allowed me to focus on details, this lens made it possible to get more of the surroundings into the frame.

Winter was over, and while the trees did not yet get their leaves, the grass was already started to get greener, and, occasionally, small flowers started to show up among fallen leaves from the last year.

It would’ve been harder to depict how tall are the trees in the forest without a wide lens: when you meet someone on the path, they can look very small in comparison.

I really liked the texture of the sprawling oak branches against the sky. I hope the conditions in your code don’t look like this:

While most of the trees were leafless, some smaller trees had leaves sprouting on them, and flowers starting to bloom.

That day the weather was nice, and there were several people in the forest, either walking by themselves, or with their dogs.

To the east of the forest there is a long terrace that is overlooking Paris. It is a part of the park, and has a few entrances in the wall that surrounds its park area.

It is always a great view from the terrace.

After walking through the terrace and the park, I entered the city again, and went back home through its narrow streets.

![Well, that’s not a street, of course.](pixelfed:813876267816731263)

I like to use different paths when getting back from my walks: it if nice to notice new things and places that you did not see before.

Courtyards are often closed off, but sometimes you can peek there, and they can be pretty interesting too.

It is nice to revisit some of the older photos and older memories. I still have many photos posted on Pixelfed that I will share here in the future, and even more that I did not publish anywhere yet.

I need to get a habit to post more, and go out with a camera more.
